In the case of maternal mortality, that means creating a software that can record scans from an ultrasound wand as it glides over a pregnant woman's stomach, and then analyze those images for potential fetal abnormalities or other signals that something is wrong. Globally, the maternal mortality rate is 152 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the Gates Foundation, and a 2016 National Vital Statistics report found that 15% of women in the U.S. who gave birth received inadequate prenatal care. The WHO recommends women have at least an ultrasound before 24 weeks gestation. Ultrasound imaging requires fairly high level of expertise and requires a technician or nurse to make an initial assessment, before handing it off to a doctor. Google is suggesting that its technology could provide the technical expertise instead. ""The idea is that we think we can actually help a relatively untrained operator get some of the basics,"" says Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google.
